# Dataset-Generator (April 2021)

This code have been developed following my need to generate or compute large dataset for deep-learning applications. 
This project is developed in OOP following another similar project that I had initially written following script method. [***datamining-scripts***](https://github.com/Idelcads/datamining-scripts)

## Information System

---
I'm using `PyTorch 1.8.0`, `cudatoolkit 11.1`, `alphapose 0.3.0+d009b4d`, `detectron2 0.4+cu111` in `Python 3.6`. \
cuda 11.1, cuDNN 8.1.0, Geforce RTX 3080\
Linux Ubuntu 20.01 focal fossa
